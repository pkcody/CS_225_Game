State pattern, Dependency Injection, and Decorator Pattern were some design patterns I added in this project (learned from studying Baron David's "Hands On Game Develompent Patters with Unity." This project is for my C++ classes to practice implementing concepts into our own projects. I chose to work on a basic game that involves chosing a character and then jumping from platform to platform trying to get enough coins to win.
